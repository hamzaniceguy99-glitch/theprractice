## Before you promote this site

| Priority | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Blocking | Legal page: fill every `[BRACKET]` (legal name, address, state, payment provider). Have a lawyer review it if you can. | `legal.html` |
| 🟠 Important | `contact@theprractice.shop` doesn't exist yet: set up free email forwarding in Namecheap (*Domain List → Manage → Redirect Email*). | Namecheap |
| 🟠 Important | Contact form: replace `VOTRE_ID_FORMSPREE` with your Formspree id (until then it falls back to `mailto:`). | `contact.html` |
| 🟠 Important | Add a real introduction of the coach (name, background, photo). Never invent credentials. | `about.html` |
| 🟡 Later | Prices ($29 / $79 / $159) and plan contents should match what you actually sell. | `index.html` `#pricing` |
| 🟡 Later | Testimonials: only add real ones, with permission. Fake reviews are illegal (FTC). | — |

## Business description (Stripe, directories…)

```
Coaching in target archery, delivered online: one-on-one video sessions and small group sessions covering form and alignment, building a repeatable shot sequence, basic equipment tuning and setup, and structured practice and competition preparation. Archers follow an 8 to 12 week program with video review of their shooting each week. All coaching is remote: range safety rules and supervision are the archer's responsibility, and equipment changes should be checked by a qualified technician. Services are sold as month-to-month subscriptions from $29 to $159 per month, cancellable at any time. No equipment is sold or shipped. Site: theprractice.shop
